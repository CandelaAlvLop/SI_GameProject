Project Pizza Game 3D

In the initial configuration phase, we have created the game environment, integrating the necessary elements. We incorporate the prefabs of the pizza ingredients that we will use, as well as the boxes that will contain said ingredients. The pizza itself is represented with the shapes of the ingredients, serving as a visual guide for the player when creating the pizza. Players are represented by hands, all prefabs and selected elements were obtained from the website https://poly.pizza/.

Furthermore, for the floor that represents the table where the pizza has to be created, we have used textures obtained from the Asset Store, specifically from the package https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/wooden-pbr-table-112005.

The scripts we've modified so far focus on player movement. In particular, in the PlayerMovement script, we have implemented the functionality so that when colliding with an ingredient box, the sound "pop_sound.wav" plays. This simulates the act of picking up an item.

In addition, we have integrated sounds related to the action of picking up objects and the pizza cooking process.
